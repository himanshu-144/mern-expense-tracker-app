A web application to track personal expenses, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

MongoDB - Database for storing expenses
Express.js - Backend framework to handle API requests
React- Frontend library to build the user interface
Node.js - Runtime environment for running the backend server


Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/himanshu-144/mern-expense-tracker-app.git
 cd mern-expense-tracker-app


Create a .env file in the root directory for the backend and add the following keys:
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key


Then run a "npm run build" command for installing packages for client and server

Then run "npm start" command 

Both client and server will run on "http://localhost:8000"
